<h2 style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 600; margin-top: 28px; margin-bottom: 12px; color: #1a1a1a;">Acceptance of Terms</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12px; line-height: 1.6; color: #444;">By accessing our website or placing an order with Drop Dead, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to all of these terms, please do not use our site or purchase our products.</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 600; margin-top: 28px; margin-bottom: 12px; color: #1a1a1a;">Products</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12px; line-height: 1.6; color: #444;">Drop Dead sells hair extensions and related hair products. We make every effort to display colors and textures accurately. However, <strong>color, texture, and length may vary slightly</strong> from what appears on screen due to natural variation in hair, monitor settings, and lighting differences. These slight variations are not considered defects.</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 600; margin-top: 28px; margin-bottom: 12px; color: #1a1a1a;">Color Matching</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12px; line-height: 1.6; color: #444;">We offer complimentary color matching consultations to help you find the best shade. While we strive for accuracy, color matching results are <strong>approximate</strong> and depend on the quality of photos and lighting provided. <strong>Color-matched orders are final sale once opened.</strong> If the match is off, contact us within 48 hours for a one-time exchange — see our Return Policy for details.</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 600; margin-top: 28px; margin-bottom: 12px; color: #1a1a1a;">Installation</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12px; line-height: 1.6; color: #444;">Drop Dead does not provide hair extension installation services. We are <strong>not liable for any damage</strong> to your natural hair, scalp, or the extensions themselves resulting from improper installation, removal, or maintenance. We recommend having extensions installed by a licensed professional stylist.</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 600; margin-top: 28px; margin-bottom: 12px; color: #1a1a1a;">Age Requirement</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12px; line-height: 1.6; color: #444;">You must be <strong>18 years of age or older</strong> to make a purchase from Drop Dead. By placing an order, you confirm that you meet this age requirement.</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 600; margin-top: 28px; margin-bottom: 12px; color: #1a1a1a;">Intellectual Property</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12px; line-height: 1.6; color: #444;">All content on this website — including text, images, logos, product photography, and branding — is the property of <strong>Drop Dead LLC</strong> and is protected by applicable intellectual property laws.

<p style="margin-bottom: 12px; line-height: 1.6; color: #444;">Drop Dead LLC is <strong>not liable</strong> for allergic reactions, skin irritation, hair damage, or any injury resulting from improper use of our products or third-party installation. We strongly recommend performing a <strong>patch test</strong> before first use and consulting a dermatologist if you have known sensitivities. Our total liability shall not exceed the purchase price of the product in question.</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 600; margin-top: 28px; margin-bottom: 12px; color: #1a1a1a;">Governing Law</h2>

Any disputes arising from these terms shall be resolved in the courts of the State of Florida.</p>
