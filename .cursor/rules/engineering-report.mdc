# Engineering Report Maintenance (HARD RULE)

## When This Applies

Any time you make changes to the agent system — tools, prompts, coordinator, tool-executor, specialists, knowledge modules, model routing, billing, or feature flags.

## Procedure

After completing agent-related changes, update the engineering report at:
`.cursor/plans/agent_architecture_engineering_report_ca2dc7e9.plan.md`

Sections to check and update:
1. **Tool count** in Section 5 header if tools were added/removed
2. **Tool tables** in Section 5 if tool definitions changed
3. **Limits table** in Section 4 if iteration limits, thresholds, or budgets changed
4. **Enforcement layers** in Section 7 if guards were added/modified
5. **Escalation chain** in Section 8 if escalation logic changed
6. **Model routing** in Section 13 if models or routing rules changed
7. **Feature flags** in Section 17 if flags were added/changed
8. **Known gaps** in Section 19 if gaps were closed or new ones found
9. **Files modified** in Section 12 for the changelog
10. **Date** in the header (update "last updated" date)

## Never

- Never skip this update when agent architecture changes
- Never leave the tool count or limits table stale after changes
- Never add a tool without adding it to the report
