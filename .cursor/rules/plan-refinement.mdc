# Plan Refinement Protocol (HARD RULE)

## When This Applies

This applies EVERY TIME you are about to call CreatePlan or present a plan to the user -- whether in Plan mode, Agent mode, or any other context. There are NO exceptions.

## Procedure (MUST follow in order)

You MUST complete ALL FOUR passes before calling CreatePlan. Do NOT call CreatePlan after only a first draft. If you catch yourself about to present a plan without having run the four passes, STOP and run them.

### Step 1: Draft the plan internally (do NOT present it yet)

Write the plan in your thinking/reasoning. This is the raw first draft.

### Step 2: Run Pass 1 -- Challenge Architecture

Launch an explore subagent to challenge the fundamental approach BEFORE refining details. This pass exists because optimizing the wrong architecture wastes effort. The subagent must answer:

- **Reference system comparison**: How does Cursor (or the equivalent best-in-class reference) handle this? Do they even have this problem? If not, why not? What is architecturally different?
- **Root cause vs. symptom**: Are we adding complexity to work around a design decision we should change instead? Is this plan a band-aid over a deeper issue?
- **Assumption audit**: List every implicit assumption the plan makes. For each one, ask: is this actually true? Could it be wrong? What breaks if it is?
- **Capability gates**: Does the plan introduce any capability gates, separate code paths, or mode-specific logic that could cause context loss, state fragmentation, or pipeline splits? If yes, can we unify into a single pipeline with preference-level hints instead?
- **Complexity smell test**: If this plan requires more than one "recovery" or "acceleration" mechanism to handle edge cases between subsystems, the architecture may be wrong. Flag it.

If this pass identifies a fundamental architectural flaw, STOP and redesign the approach before proceeding to Pass 2. Do not refine details on a broken foundation.

Fold all findings into the draft before proceeding.

### Step 3: Run Pass 2 -- Gap Analysis

Launch an explore subagent to audit the draft for:
- Missing steps, unhandled edge cases, implicit assumptions
- Tasks that lack clear inputs, outputs, or acceptance criteria
- Functionalities that would strengthen the solution
- Items to flag for future phases (scalability, extensibility, tech debt)

Fold all findings into the draft before proceeding.

### Step 4: Run Pass 3 -- Refinement and Enhancement

Launch an explore subagent (can run in parallel with Pass 4) to:
- Re-evaluate after Pass 2 corrections for remaining gaps
- Confirm every task is fully defined to accomplish the goal
- Propose additional improvements that elevate the solution
- Answer: What functionalities and improvements would make this even better?

Fold all findings into the draft before proceeding.

### Step 5: Run Pass 4 -- UI Surface and Design System Compliance

Launch an explore subagent to:
- Verify every new/changed feature is surfaced in the UI where applicable
- Confirm all UI follows the design system (app/globals.css):
  - Light/dark mode: dark: variant pairs -- never hardcoded
  - Colors: stone neutrals, sky interactive, accent green #28CD56 for CTAs
  - Backgrounds: bg-[#fafaf9] dark:bg-[#0a0a0a]
  - Borders: border-stone-200 dark:border-white/5 or dark:border-white/10
  - Glass cards: GlassCard with theme=light
  - Typography: text-stone-900 dark:text-white headings, text-stone-600 dark:text-gray-400 body
  - Inputs: bg-white dark:bg-white/5, border-stone-300 dark:border-white/10
- Flag and fix any non-compliant components

Fold all findings into the draft.

### Step 6: Present the final plan

NOW call CreatePlan with the fully refined plan. The plan you present must be the output of all four passes, not the first draft.

## Enforcement

If the user points out that a plan was not refined, acknowledge the failure, run the passes immediately, and present the corrected plan. Do not make excuses.
