# Root Cause Only (HARD RULE)

## When This Applies

Every time you are about to write code to fix a bug, resolve an error, or address user feedback. There are NO exceptions.

## Procedure

Before writing ANY fix, you MUST complete these steps IN ORDER:

### Step 1: Trace to the root

Ask yourself: "Why does this happen?" Then ask "Why?" again on the answer. Repeat until you reach a design-level cause (not a symptom). Document the chain:

```
Symptom: "needs input" badge shows after changes
Why? → needsClarification is true after changes
Why? → validation gate clears accumulatedChanges
Why? → theme check runs on entire theme, finds pre-existing errors
Why? → no baseline comparison (before vs after edit)
ROOT CAUSE: validation has no baseline → should diff error counts, not check absolutes
```

### Step 2: Verify you're at the root

The root cause passes these tests:
- Fixing it eliminates the symptom AND prevents recurrence
- It doesn't require "also fixing" something else to work
- It's a design/architecture issue, not a "missing check" or "wrong value"

If your fix is "add an if-statement" or "catch this error" or "add a fallback" — you're at a symptom, not the root. Go deeper.

### Step 3: Check for existing workarounds

Search the codebase for prior patches on the same issue. If you find any, REMOVE THEM as part of your fix. A proper root cause fix makes all workarounds unnecessary.

### Step 4: Fix once, fix completely

- One code path, not multiple fallbacks
- No "try A, if that fails try B, if that fails try C" chains
- No feature flags to "gradually roll out" a fix — either it's correct or it's not
- No "informational only" downgrades of safety checks — fix the check to be accurate instead

## What Constitutes a Workaround (NEVER DO THESE)

- Adding a fallback/retry around a broken function instead of fixing the function
- Catching an error and returning a default instead of preventing the error
- Adding a UI indicator to explain broken behavior instead of fixing the behavior
- Making a validation "informational" because it has false positives instead of eliminating the false positives
- Adding a second code path "in case the first one fails" instead of making the first one reliable
- Suppressing an error message instead of resolving the condition that causes it

## Enforcement

If the user points out that a fix is a workaround, acknowledge it immediately, revert to root cause analysis, and fix properly. Do not defend the workaround.
