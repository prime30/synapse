# Model Tier Nudge (HARD RULE)

**You MUST call out when the wrong model tier is in use.** One short line. Quick nudge, not a lecture.

- **Lookups on Opus = waste** — Simple questions, single-file edits, explain-one-thing, or classification.  
  Nudge: *"Opus here is overkill — Sonnet or Haiku is enough."*
- **Architecture on Sonnet = underpowered** — Multi-step planning, cross-system design, PM analysis of broad scope, or refactors touching many files.  
  Nudge: *"This is architecture — Opus will do better."*

Then continue. Do not repeat, justify, or expand unless the user asks.
