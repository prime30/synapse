  "responseText": "Accessibility issues in product-thumbnail.liquid:\n\n1. Interactive div without keyboard semantics — <div data-t4s-gallery--open> is clickable but uses a div, not a button. No role=\"button\", tabindex=\"0\", or keyboard event handlers.\n\n2. Alt text can silently become empty — The complex t4option/underscore parsing logic can produce blank img_alt. No final fallback to product.title.\n\n3. Hidden variant media lacks aria-hidden — isMediaHidden adds a CSS class but screen readers still traverse hidden content.\n\n4. No focus indicators — No :focus-visible styles on gallery-open element.\n\n5. Video/model media has no accessible label — Deferred media template renders with no aria-label indicating media type.\n\n6. Noscript images duplicate content — Both lazy-loaded img and noscript fallback exist in DOM.\n\n7. No prefers-reduced-motion check — t4s-lz--fadeIn animation plays regardless of user motion preferences.\n\n8. Placeholder data:image/gif announced as image — Base64 placeholder GIF has real alt text before actual image loads.",
